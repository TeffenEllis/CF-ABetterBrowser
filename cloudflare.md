This CloudFlare app adds a simple text message at the top of your website if the visitor's browser version is too old.

Specfically, if the visitor is using Internet Explorer 6 or 7 (any version lower than 8), the message will appear, with a link to [ABetterBrowser.org](http://abetterbrowser.org/).

The message reads:

"You are using an outdated browser. [More information &#187;](http://abetterbrowser.org/)"

There are links to five different modern browsers there, including the most recent version of Internet Explorer.
